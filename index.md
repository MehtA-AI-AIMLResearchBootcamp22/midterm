            <h3>Identifying Author of book from text.</h3>
            <p>When first attempting to solve this problem, the first question is what really distinguishes the writing styles of men and women. Though research, we found that the topics are often different, but this cannnot be used here due to the common topics of the documents. One instrumental finding was that on average women use more pronouns and adjectives than men which is something we could quantify and use to distinguish the documents.</p><br>
            <p> 
            Before we knew about the differences, we were complacent with just putting the whole text in a machine and letting it figure it out, which worked surprisingly well, but this doesn't help the user understand what's going on and often wastes resources like energy for the computer has to calculate larger datasets that are often very sparse. So we opted to use many of the natural language processing libraries we'd been taught in class to separate the text by part of speech and then to specifically give the model only the pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs.
